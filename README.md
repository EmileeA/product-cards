# HW Week 2
## Study Group Assignment:
1. [Product Cards](https://github.com/nss-nightclass-projects/exercise-vault/blob/master/HTML_CSS_product_cards.md) Each person should make a girhub repo called product-cards and a local folder in this location: `~/workspace/foundations/exercises/product-cards`.  You should be using flexbox.  Decide as a team how many branches you will need and what will happen on each branch (remember one feature per branch).
